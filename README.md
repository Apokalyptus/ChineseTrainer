# ChineseTrainer
This Project was initially written in 2007/2008 to trick myself learning my chinese vocabulary. 
The Program resides in the windows tray area and fades vocabulary in and out. 
I figured out, that if outlook is announcing that it got a new Mail is always very attractive to the eye. 
I wantet to use this effect to get the attention to the vocabulary. So far I have to say it works ;)

The Software also has some tiny training mode which can hide either the German vocabulary (works also with any other language), or the pinyin. 
If you press space you can peek whether you where right or not. 

It contains also little config, like whoch chapter to take, fading intervals, randomness.
Further it has a basic Editor to enter the vocabulary and some additional data.

The Project was written in c# and uses Winforms
